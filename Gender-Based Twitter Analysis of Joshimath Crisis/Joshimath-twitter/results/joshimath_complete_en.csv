Till now the land in Joshimath was only sinking. Now the water has started bursting after bursting the ground.

 Today around 2:00 pm, glasses of water burst in the premises of Jaypee Company located in Marwari.

Last night also there was a tremor of land subsidence here. After this, the doors of some houses were also jammed.

In Haldwani, the Congress used its full force to save the people from being destroyed. Who has stopped BJP from saving Joshimath?

Joshimath is the gateway to Badrinath Dham and the penance place of Adi Shankaracharya. The campaign to save Joshimath is also being run by a leftist.

Thank you Nidhi ji, Shankaracharya Math and Kalpavriksha have also developed cracks. This sorrow is not only of 500 families. I am saying again and again, this harm is to all those people who have faith in Hindu religion and faith. And those who are not corporeal, then they worship the energy power of mountains, water and rivers in formless form. twitter.com/nidhitripathi9…

#JoshimathIsSinking ; As seen from various photos posted on media, it's not just sinking.
It's a serious warning that whole mountain of this part will collapse. Also some channels of water may get choked & some newer one will be created & lower stretches may suffer a flood

Have the ISRO people gone mad? Released the report on Joshimath without the permission of the government.

Modi government should take strict action. Two-four should be punished with 100-100 lashes.

Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat says that if there was a Devasthanam Board today, there would have been an income of 125 to 150 crores. With that, Joshimath could be restored. We do not have to wander for money. It is my misfortune that I could not make people understand. @tsrawatbjp

One thing that Uttarakhand has ignored for long is looking at the climate crisis through the lens of mental health. It is high time that advocacy on climate change focuses on mental health and well-being because events like Joshimath have profound psychological impacts.

Not everyone is friendly.
The people of the entire state are not brothers and sisters for all.
By becoming a part of the government, people put their faith at stake.
Some speak against the wrong system only when one of their own becomes its victim.
A few years ago, one such young man yearned for his brother who died in a road accident.

No matter how beautiful the city you come to, the home you leave behind always makes you restless.
Under the hydropower project, 70 families of Lohari village were asked to vacate their houses within 48 hours.
Think of that sorrow, how would it be to see the village drowning in front of your eyes?

If there was a program of singing and dancing, there would be no place left to put feet. The gathering of only so many people from Delhi-NCR on the question of Joshimath shows the thinking of us hills. Living in Delhi Hills! The number of your village will also come. Write it down..
So! Questions should arise, no matter how many people there are.

To save the crumbling Joshimath, a huge crowd took to the streets carrying torches.
The heat of these torches reached the insensitive power.

Railway and Dhami government should suck lemon! Get it empty now. Those who have to do it, they get them evacuated straight away. Those who want to be satisfied, they first make noise that bulldozers will come on such and such date. Then they moo like goats, what should we do, the Supreme Court has imposed a stay.

The only correct solution to the Joshimath issue is for all affected people to hire a good SC lawyer and slap a huge fine on the government. Words and sympathy neither fills one's stomach nor builds a home. @atulsati1 There will be no ideological differences on this subject, so it is possible to raise funds for the common man?

Till now the land in Joshimath was only sinking. Now the water has started bursting after bursting the ground.

 Today around 2:00 pm, glasses of water burst in the premises of Jaypee Company located in Marwari.

Last night also there was a tremor of land subsidence here. After this, the doors of some houses were also jammed.

Joshimath is horrified.

The wrong policies and decisions of development have started digging the grave of Joshimath, the historical city of Uttarakhand. Also know the major reasons for the wastage. Electricity tunnel passing under the belly of the city, haphazard construction and environmental imbalance.
Government should break the silence… 'Jyotirmath' is not just a city…

Till now the land in Joshimath was only sinking. Now the water has started bursting after bursting the ground.

 Today around 2:00 pm, glasses of water burst in the premises of Jaypee Company located in Marwari.

Last night also there was a tremor of land subsidence here. After this, the doors of some houses were also jammed.

The report of 1976 told about what is happening today in Joshimath, which is situated on sloping and friable land. Then the report of 2006 told, but governments kept coming and going, no one cared. See, the script of what is happening today was written 4 decades ago.

Krishna said that sin will increase, I will come.
But
Buddha had said that when sin increases people will die then no God will come
It was a sin to dig too much in the name of infrastructure.
Development without standard.

In the battle of development and nature, only nature wins.
This is what we will have to see whenever we keep playing with nature for our own selfishness and utility.
Breaking mountains for road, electricity and cutting trees is an example of how harmful it is, today Joshimath is in trouble.

 Yes?

Still saying 30% is the problem!

If the foundation of a building is damaged in 30% part, will the CM remain in it?

A mountain is also like a building,
30% ok?

Leading From The Front

Deputy CM @brajeshpathakup appeared on the spot as soon as the building collapsed in Lucknow. Kept monitoring the rescue of the injured. He reached even before the top officials. This proactive approach should be in the people's representatives. This also puts pressure on the bureaucracy to act.

It is the responsibility of the whole country to save the Himalayas.
Himalayas will be saved only then human life will be saved. The manner in which natural calamities are coming in Uttarakhand are man-made.
To avoid all this, there should be strict rules in Uttarakhand on the lines of other Himalayan states.
