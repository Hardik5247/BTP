Haldwani's disaster was man-made, for the time being it was pacified by the court. But in Joshimath the competition is with nature. Man has always proved to be a dwarf in front of nature. Playing with nature is proving dangerous for Joshimath? There is deep sympathy for the residents there.

7 Jan","The Mishra Committee constituted in 1976 under the chairmanship of Garhwal Commissioner had given a report on the condition of Joshimath.
How many leaders have come to Pareta since 1976 till date. The attitude remains the same that right now the water is knee deep, if you start drowning then you will learn to swim or cry.
Now every house cracks - every house water!

The visuals coming in from Joshimath, Uttarakhand are horrifying. Natural calamity and the pain of leaving your home is troubling everyone. I hope that the Government of Uttarakhand and the Central Government will take appropriate steps at the time of this disaster and give strength to the people there.

Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat says that if there was a Devasthanam Board today, there would have been an income of 125 to 150 crores. With that, Joshimath could be restored. We do not have to wander for money. It is my misfortune that I could not make people understand. @tsrawatbjp

One thing that Uttarakhand has ignored for long is looking at the climate crisis through the lens of mental health. It is high time that advocacy on climate change focuses on mental health and well-being because events like Joshimath have profound psychological impacts.

The video is several years old!

The one whose voice is in this video always blames the hills of the mountain after the #BJP government comes....

Nowadays #JoshimathIsSinking is also cursing the people of #Joshimath and gets his disciples to do the same...

Not everyone is friendly.
The people of the entire state are not brothers and sisters for all.
By becoming a part of the government, people put their faith at stake.
Some speak against the wrong system only when one of their own becomes its victim.
A few years ago, one such young man yearned for his brother who died in a road accident.

It is that forty or thirty percent part which is being said to be the most dangerous.
This part has parallel cracks from top to bottom. Below is the colony of Jaiprakash company from where the water of NTPC tunnel leaked. Which is still going on. Here two to two and a half feet of ground went down.

You get big contracts made for China.
Get your relations removed from your village.
You go around China the most.

Till now the land in Joshimath was only sinking. Now the water has started bursting after bursting the ground.

 Today around 2:00 pm, glasses of water burst in the premises of Jaypee Company located in Marwari.

Last night also there was a tremor of land subsidence here. After this, the doors of some houses were also jammed.

Joshimath is horrified.

Till now the land in Joshimath was only sinking. Now the water has started bursting after bursting the ground.

 Today around 2:00 pm, glasses of water burst in the premises of Jaypee Company located in Marwari.

Last night also there was a tremor of land subsidence here. After this, the doors of some houses were also jammed.

Joshimath is horrified.

In the battle of development and nature, only nature wins.
This is what we will have to see whenever we keep playing with nature for our own selfishness and utility.
Breaking mountains for road, electricity and cutting trees is an example of how harmful it is, today Joshimath is in trouble.
