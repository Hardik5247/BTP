The 'destruction' of Joshimath pained the displacement of Kureda Tehri; Big trouble in front of more than 500 families.
People displaced from Tehri still cry for their drowned Tehri. It has been 20 years but that pain is still not old for the people of Old Tehri.

No matter how beautiful the city you come to, the home you leave behind always makes you restless.
Under the hydropower project, 70 families of Lohari village were asked to vacate their houses within 48 hours.
Think of that sorrow, how would it be to see the village drowning in front of your eyes?

It is the responsibility of the whole country to save the Himalayas.
Himalayas will be saved only then human life will be saved. The manner in which natural calamities are coming in Uttarakhand are man-made.
To avoid all this, there should be strict rules in Uttarakhand on the lines of other Himalayan states.
