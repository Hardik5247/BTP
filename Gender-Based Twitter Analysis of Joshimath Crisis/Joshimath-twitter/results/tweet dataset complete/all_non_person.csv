After the Joshimath tragedy, any kind of work has been banned in the area. Despite this, the work of cutting the mountain is going on in Tapovan.
Mountains are being cut using drill hammer machines and the work of widening the roads is going on. Tapovan is only 12 km away from Joshimath.

Seeing the crack on the biggest symbol of Hindus, the temple of Adi Shankaracharya and the Kalpavriksha under which Shankaracharya had meditated, I was shaken to the core. It is surprising that a minister, MP, big people could not reach here. People have been left to fend for themselves.

Disaster has knocked on the door, there is only despair in the eyes of the people.. neither any politician is seen with these people of Joshimath, nor anyone in the Supreme Court, nor anyone is silent...maybe everyone is waiting for the holocaust ...

God bless Badri Vishal

The report of 1976 told about what is happening today in Joshimath, which is situated on sloping and friable land. Then the report of 2006 told, but governments kept coming and going, no one cared. See, the script of what is happening today was written 4 decades ago.

1) Mountains with glaciers.
2) Rapid flow of Alaknanda river.
3) Construction work in excess of capacity.
4) Lack of good drainage system.
5) Lack of sewer system.
6) Landslides due to continuous cutting of forests.

Joshimath History - It starts from Tapovan, about 15 kms away from Joshimath. Let us tell you that half of the tunnel work has been completed, but the work has been stopped as soon as the news of cracks is received.
