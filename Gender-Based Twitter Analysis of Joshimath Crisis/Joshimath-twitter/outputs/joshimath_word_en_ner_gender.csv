Remember the Amar Chitra Katha stories? Every time the rishis or devas sat to do yagya or something important, danavs & asuras tried to disrupt/destroy it.
There's a lesson in that on how the world operates in general. Remember how it always ends? The righteous win :)

What is the main reason for land subsidence in Joshimath, another city will disappear in the coming years
The area above Joshimath receives a lot of snowfall and heavy rains. When the weather changes and the snow melts, then the flow of water in the rivers around Joshimath increases. This is also one of the reasons for the weakening of the surface and landslides.

The HC declared that the 5 petitioners weren't 'social activists' and imposed a fine of ‚Çπ10,000 on each one.
And then, it is expected of people to respect and trust the judiciary.
Wow!

If this had been heard fairly, Joshimath could have been saved. Accountability??

Shocking!The activists&residents of Joshimath had gone to the Uttarakhand HC in June 21(after the Rishiganga disaster of Feb 21, in which 150 workers were buried in the tunnel of the Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel tunnel)to stop the Hydel projects. The HC dismissed it by imposing costs!
