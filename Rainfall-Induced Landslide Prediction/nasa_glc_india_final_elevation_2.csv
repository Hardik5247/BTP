Meanwhile, movement of trains on the world-heritage Kalka-Shimla railway line came to a halt today due to massive landslides at several places.  A retired government employee, BD Bhut, came under a massive tree last night as two big trees hit a building at Phagli area on the outskirts of Shimla town. There are also unconfirmed reports about two more weather-related deaths in the state, taking the total toll to 10.  All the ten trains running on the Kalka-Shimla railway line have been suspended as there are massive landslides between Kathalighat and Knoh railway stations, about 15 km from here. Rail officials informed HimVani that two landslides, triggered by excessive rainfall, between Solan and Shimla forced them to suspend operation of trains since last night.
