This year’s monsoon has been the worse by far.  Most interior villagers of Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire are cut out from the rest of the state. With good roads beyond their dreams even on dry days, rainy days are a nightmare for the people. Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before. The use of roads by all size vehicles has spoilt most of the soiled roads making it difficult for smaller vehicles to ply.
